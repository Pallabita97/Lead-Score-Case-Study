# Lead-Score-Case-Study
Building a logistic regression model to assign a lead score between 0 and 100 of the each of the leads which is used by the company to find potential leads where higher score means people are more likely to convert and lower score means people are less likely to convert. There is some other problems presented by the company which model should be able to adjust to if the company requirement changes in the future so we will need to handle this as well.
